Static structural analysis of a 6-DOF robotic arm using SolidWorks

## Project Overview
This project involves the mechanical design and static structural analysis of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robotic arm using SolidWorks Simulation. The objective was to evaluate structural integrity under applied loading conditions.

## Analysis Setup
- Material properties defined within SolidWorks
- Fixed support boundary condition applied at the base
- External load equivalent to 50 kg (~490 N) applied at the end-effector
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA) performed
- Von Mises stress criterion used for failure evaluation

## Evaluation Parameters
- Maximum von Mises stress distribution
- Maximum displacement and deformation
- Factor of Safety (FOS)
- Stress concentration regions

## Results
The analysis identified critical stress regions near joint connections and load-bearing sections. 
Maximum displacement was evaluated to ensure functional rigidity. 
Factor of Safety was calculated to verify structural reliability under the applied load.

## Tools Used
- SolidWorks
